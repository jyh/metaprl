(*
 * The "set" type is used to relate CZF to the Nuprl type theory.
 * The set type is defined inductively.
 *    The base types are:
 *       1. int
 *       2. fun{A; x.B[x]}
 *       3. exists{A; x.B[x]}
 *       4. union{A; B}
 *       5. equal{A; a; b}
 *
 *    The inductive construction is given by rule:
 *       6. H >- T in U1         H, x:T >- a in set
 *          -------------------------------------
 *               H >- collect{T; x. a[x]} in set
 *
 * We could define this set recursively.  Instead, we define it
 * as a collection of rules.
