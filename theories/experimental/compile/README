This is an experimental theory to determine whether it is
easy to use MetaPRL to build a compiler.

The language is called "M".  The AST is (to be) defined in
m_ast.ml, and the IR is in m_ir.ml.

A question from Brian Aydemir (emre@cs.caltech.edu):

(1) What is the evaluation order for the M language IR: eager or lazy?  This
    affects at least dead-code elimination.  A rewrite such as

         LetAtom{'a; v. 'e} <--> 'e

    will change the program's semantics under eager evaluation (suppose the
    atom contained a division by zero).
