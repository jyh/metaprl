Mojave FIR Theory
BUGS
by Brian Emre Aydemir (emre@cs.caltech.edu)

Below, I have listed every bug in the Mojave FIR theory that I am
aware of.  They are listed in no particular order.  I have also listed,
at the end, things that might be considered bugs, but really aren't.


-- Cannot give a type for functions of zero arguments (see Mfir_ty!tyFun).

-- No terms are declared for subops.  If I implement these,
   perhaps they should go in their own file, e.g. Mfir_subop.

-- No terms are declared for the FIR object system, including tyCase,
   and tyObject.  These should go in Mfir_ty.

-- No terms are declared for the following unary operators:
      pointerOfBlockOp     lengthOfBlockOp
   These should go in Mfir_exp.  (They depend on subops.)

-- No term is declared for the binary operators plusPointerOp.
   It should go in Mfir_exp.

-- No terms are declared for the following atoms:
      atomNil              atomSizeOf
      atomConst            atomFun
      atomFloat
   These should go in Mfir_exp.


Things that might look like bugs, but really aren't:

-- The term tyDelayed is not declared.  See the README for why this is.

-- No terms for debugging info in the FIR are declared.
   See the README for why this is.
