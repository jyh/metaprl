Mojave FIR Theory
BUGS
by Brian Emre Aydemir (emre@cs.caltech.edu)

Below, I have listed every bug in the Mojave FIR theory that I am
aware of.  They are listed in no particular order.  I have also listed,
at the end, things that might be considered bugs, but really aren't.


-- Cannot give a type for functions of zero arguments (see Mfir_ty!tyFun).

-- No terms are declared for dependent tuples, including tyDefDTuple
   and tyDTuple, and tyTag.  These should go in Mfir_ty.

-- No terms are declared for frames, including tyFrame and frame.
   These should go in Mfir_ty.

-- No terms are declared for the FIR object system, including tyCase,
   and tyObject.  These should go in Mfir_ty.


Things that might look like bugs, but really aren't:

-- The term tyDelayed is not declared.  See the README for why this is.
