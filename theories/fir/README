Mojave FIR theory
README
by Brian Emre Aydemir (emre@cs.caltech.edu)

I have made every attempt to document the Mojave FIR theory.  A great
majority of the documentation can be found in the theories.pdf file
generated by running ``make latex''.  Any remaining documentation
is likely to be in the form of comments in .ml files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following remarks by Brian Emre Aydemir (emre) are intended to
serve as notes to himself.  They may not make sense to others.

-- Must _not_ include anything from ITT.  Otherwise, we get
   a soup of logical inconsistencies/differences.

-- Dropping anything that is related to the object system.
   It is unsound.  Also dropping anything not covered in the
   technical report.

-- MetaPRL theories are open, so we can not do induction over a set of
   rules.  In particular, there's no way we can formalize the proofs
   of the technical report without going through some trouble.

-- mfir_exp display forms may be a bit wacky since I haven't tested them.
