   @module[Itt_image]

   The @tt{Itt_image} adds a new type constructor <<Img{'A, x.'f['x]}>> with ther
   following semantics:

   If $A$ is a type with a PER $P_a$, then <<Img{'A, x.'f['x]}>> is a type with the
   the PER Transitive closure$(<<('f['a]='f['b] in Img{'A, x.'f['x]) <=> ('a='b in 'A)>>)$
