These are just some general notes about what's here.  Perhaps one day
I'll actually turn this into a full fledged readme that's generally useful...

fir_type* files are for typing rules/judgements.
All the other files declare terms for FIR terms and rewrites
to evaluate such terms.

Note that some terms declared (and maybe entire files) may be
there only for completeness or becuase I think I might need them later
(or haven't bothered removing them yet).

Subscripting is still a bit iffy at this point, especially given
that there's a bazillino subscripting operators.  I'm pretty much
ignoring them all at this point.

The typing rules definitely also need a lot of work at this point.
