THIS FILE IS REALLY INCOMPLETE!

I describe the purpose of this theory and its implementation in this file.


Overview:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The purpose of this theory is to provide a formal representation of the
Mojave compiler's FIR.

<< more information should go here eventually >>


Compilation issues:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
While this theory is intended to compile with (as in, be linked with)
the Mojave compiler, though it will compile without as well.  In order
to compile with MC, you must set the MC_ROOT environment variable to point to
the the root directory of MC.


Module -- Mp_mc_term_op:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
This module provides basic term construction and deconstruction operations
similar to those in Refiner.Refiner.TermOp.  The most notable difference is my
naming scheme for the functions.  This scheme and other information is
documented in mp_mc_term_op.mli.
