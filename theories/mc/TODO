This file lists what I have remaining to do to complete this theory,
and some other miscellaneous notes to myself.

Todo list:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Display forms: These need to be tested and improved so that
   things print in a reasonable fashion.
-  FIR evaluation: This needs to be completed.
-  Test cases: I've fallen way behind on these.  These cases need
   to test display forms, rewrites, any tactic like things I define,
   and the MC FIR <--> MetaPRL connection code.
-  Documentation: Other than making a decent README file, I also
   need to document code in a slightly more useful fashion.  It would
   be nice if the same mechanism used to produce the docs for all
   the theories was used here as well.
-  Deadcode elimination: Implement more forms of it. Prove the
   forms that aren't proven.
-  Mp_mc_connect_base (special notes):
   .  Check float converstion code.
   .  Check string conversion code.

Notes to myself:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  None at the moment.

Scratch space (random thoughts to myself):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Checklist for when I need to add/remove/change a term:
   1) .mli file: term declaration, term operation function signatures
   2) .ml file: term declaration, display form, term operation functions,
   3) connect: change cases appropriately
   4) test: change cases appropriately
   5) eval: change evaluation as needed
-  Checklist for when files are added/removed:
   1) Conscript: 4 file lists to check!
   2) Makefile: 1 file list to check!
