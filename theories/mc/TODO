This file lists what I have remaining to do to complete this theory,
and some other miscellaneous notes to myself.

Todo list:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Get semantics for union / allocation / type-construction ops.
   I guess I'll include memcpy in this.
-  Make a comprehensive test file.
-  fir_deadcode - get dead parameter and function removal working.
-  fir_exp - Atomic, Debug, and Migrate term are missing.  I should
   at least declare these or something. I don't want to lose information
-  symbol_of_var_term NEEDS SERIOUS CORRECTION!!
-  term_of_rawfloat and the other needs MORE CHECKING!!
-  mc_fir_connect_ty : the set conversions (depending on
   set representation todo above).
-  re-export fir_eval.prla
-  check to see if unknownFun (Fir_eval) is dead or not.
-  Fir_eval: I need to finish this sometime...
-  rawint_set: don't I need to store the precision / signing?

-  Improve display forms: they work, but they could look nicer


Notes to myself (things to do, but only if I feel so inclined):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  building with cons breaks the "up-arrow" thingy in mpopt.
-  get the conscripts to be more intelligent (read mk/config).
-  clean up the Conscript here.
