This file lists what I have remaining to do to complete this theory,
and some other miscellaneous notes to myself.

Todo list:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Improve display forms: they work, but they could look nicer
   (Mc_set is done I think).
-  Make a comprehensive test file: probably a bunch of sequents with
   a .prla file to store the proofs.  Useful as a check to see if I
   break anything.
-  Fir_deadcode: dead function paramater and dead function elimination
   would be quite nice to have.
-  FIR modelling: I need a better understanding / implementation (e.g.
   Fir_eval), of such things as union, allocation, type construction, etc.
-  Fir_eval: re-export .prla sometime to solve copy_proof errors.
-  Mc_fir_connect_exp: fill in the missing functions (declared already).
   I may wait on the debugging stuff, as it isn't completely
   essential at this point.
-  Mc_fir_connect*: Debugging runs, and lots of them, need to be performed.
-  Fir_ty: rewrites into more managable terms will probably have to
   happen sometime.


Notes to myself (things to do, but only if I feel so inclined):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  building with cons breaks the "up-arrow" thingy in mpopt.
-  get the Conscript's to be more intelligent (e.g. read mk/config).
   they also don't catch all dependencies (hard to describe this problem).
-  clean up the Conscript in this theory.
