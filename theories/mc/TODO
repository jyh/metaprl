This file lists what I have remaining to do to complete this theory,
and some other miscellaneous notes to myself.

Todo list:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Notable omissions in FIR implementation:
   .  display forms - these are terrible at the moment.
   .  fir_ty - frame is missing.
   .  evaluation:
      -  no where near complete.
      -  semantics of division seems wrong (prove deadcode elimination
         of division by zero).
   .  deadcode elim - needs work.
   .  constant eliminatino - needs work.
   .  connection to MC:
      -  float conversion just doesn't work.  I need someone in MC to
         implement 80 bit float <--> int/string conversion.
      -  translating the fundef's only is just a hack.  I need a better,
         more robust way to represent an entire FIR program.
   .  test cases - I need to test some of the "higher level"
      MetaPRL code (deadcode, const_elim).
-  Documentation: I need it. (-: Current ideas involve the use
   of whatever mechanism generates theories.pdf.

Notes to myself:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Checklist for when I need to add/remove/change a term:
   1) .mli file: term declaration, term operation function signatures
   2) .ml file: term declaration, display form, term operation functions,
   3) connect: change cases appropriately (2 directions to check).
      this could also involve defining new functions.
   4) test: change cases appropriately
   5) eval: change evaluation as needed
-  Checklist for when files are added/removed:
   1) Conscript:  2 file lists to check
   2) Makefile:   1 file list to check

Miscellaneous (non-pressing) todo list:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
-  Clean up all the MetaPRL Conscripts.
