 * @theory[Mp_mc_theory]
 *
 * The MC theory (all it's modules have the ``@tt[Mp_mc_]'' prefix) attempts
 * to formalize the Mojave Compiler Collection's (MCC) functional intermediate
 * representation (FIR).
 *
 * (Documentation incomplete.  I should put the theory overview here.)
 *
 * The @tt[Mp_mc_theory] module itself is provided as a convenience.
 * It simply includes all the modules that make up the MC theory.
